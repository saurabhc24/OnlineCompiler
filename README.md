<h3 align="center">How to use</h4>

-   To try the code runner locally, download the codebase.
-   Make sure you have following installed in your system: `react`, `NodeJS`, `Mongodb`, `Redis` and `Bull`. I have also used `nodemon` for help in development while working in `NodeJS`.
-   To run the client-written code in their corresponding languages, you need to have `GCC` compiler and `python` installed in your machine.

Then follow the below guide to start client (frontend) and server (backend) part of the application.

<h3 align="center">Activate Client side</h4>

-   Open Terminal
-   Go to `client` directory inside the project codespace
-   Write `npm start`. This will open the client side build with react on `port:3000` on your local machine

<h3 align="center">Activate Server side</h4>

-   Open Terminal
-   Go to `backend` directory inside the project codespace
-   Write `npm run`. If you have the above mentioned entities installed on your machine, you should be able to see a log of `Listening on port 5000` and `Successfully connected to Mongodb database` on terminal window.
-   Optional: If you have `nodemon` installed on your machine, then you can use `npm run nodemon` instead of `npm run`. This will keep the backend in check on any changes made by you, and refresh the server accordingly.
